## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the file **`config.py`** to adjust the scanner and updater behavior:

```python
# Example Configuration

IP_RANGE_START = "192.168.0.1"
IP_RANGE_END   = "192.168.0.255"

PHONEBOOK_FILE = "phonebook.csv"   # or .xml / .json depending on your phones

CREDENTIALS = {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "your_password"
}

TIMEOUT = 5   # Timeout for ping/HTTP requests in seconds
```

Make sure to set the correct:

* IP range
* File path for your phonebook
* Login credentials (if your phones require authentication)
